#Restaurant-System
===

As a personal project, I have created a database application where a restaurant host can assign a party to an available table. The program can also let the host check on what a seated party has ordered as well as either add, remove, or change the order.

I used C# and MySQL for this project. 

Currently,
The user can assign customers to table, view the orders requested by the customers as well as modify them, and keep track of stock remaining.
